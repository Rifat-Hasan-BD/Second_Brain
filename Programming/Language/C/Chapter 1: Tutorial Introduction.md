## Character Arrays
* We must carefully understand the "size" of the character array and not exceed it - in C nothing is "auto-extended"

## String / Character Constants
* Languages like PHP, Python and JS treat single and double uotes nearly the same.. Both create **string** constants.
* In C single quotes are a character and double quotes are a character array (neither are a string)
* In C, a character is a byte - a short (typically 8-bit) integer.
